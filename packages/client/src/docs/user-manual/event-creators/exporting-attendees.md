### Exporting Attendees to CSV

**What it does:** Exports a list of all registered attendees for your event as a downloadable CSV file that can be opened in Excel or Google Sheets.

**Who can use it:** Only the event creator (the person who created the event).

**Where to find it:** On your event's details page, look for the "📥 Export Attendees" button (teal background).

**Step-by-step guide:**

1. **Navigate to your event**
   - Go to the Events page or My Events
   - Click on one of your created events to view details

2. **Locate the Export button**
   - Scroll to find the **📥 Export Attendees** button
   - The button has a teal background and download icon
   - Only visible if you are the event creator

3. **Export attendees**
   - Click the **📥 Export Attendees** button
   - The CSV file will automatically download to your device
   - The filename format is: `{event-title}_attendees.csv`

4. **Open the CSV file**
   - Locate the downloaded file in your Downloads folder
   - Open with Excel, Google Sheets, or any spreadsheet application
   - The file contains attendee information in columns

**What you'll see:**
