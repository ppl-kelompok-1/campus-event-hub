**Tips:**
✓ Check your spam/junk folder if you don't see the email within a few minutes
✓ The success message appears for both existing and non-existing emails for security reasons
✓ Make sure you enter the exact email address you used when registering
✗ Don't refresh the page while the form is submitting

**Common Errors:**

**"Please enter a valid email address"**
- **Cause:** The email format is incorrect (missing @ symbol, no domain, etc.)
- **Solution:** Check your email format and ensure it follows the pattern: name@domain.com

**"Email is required"**
- **Cause:** You submitted the form without entering an email address
- **Solution:** Enter your email address in the Email field before clicking Send Reset Link

**Important Security Note:**
The system will always show a success message regardless of whether the email exists in our database. This prevents malicious users from discovering which email addresses are registered in the system.
